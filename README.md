## Introduction
stylized as operate 🩺, this game is inspired by one of the beloved board games i grew up with, Operation. 

i first made this game in grade 10, which was over 3 years ago!

the original version can be found here: https://github.com/josephine-w/Terry-the-Tiger-Operation. 

the changes are listed below:


### Changes

- new graphics!
- main menu page
- rules page
- dev note page
- quit + retry buttons
- new easter egg (try to find it! :) )

## Background
as my current co-op is a.i. and machine learning based, i felt like i wanted a fun way to revisit python after all these years. i decided to remake my favourite project i've made,
except i wanted to make it 100x better and apply what i've learned about clean code and shortcuts throughout my first year at UWaterloo. thus,,,  operate 🩺 was born!

everything in this game is coded and hand drawn by me, with an exception of the tweezers clip art used for the cursor and a bit of help from the internet when needed haha :D

i hope you enjoy the game! thank you so much for reading this far :)
