	list of good stuff + list of bad stuff
		if good stuff is thrown out: health decreases by 10
		if bad stuff - nothing happens until the len(badlist) = 0

	good = happy face (clicking on it = health bar go down)

	bad = mad face (must get rid)
	- put into garbage


- new hover mechanic: hovering over objects makes them larger
